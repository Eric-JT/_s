== Description ==

Hi. I was a starter theme called _s, or underscores. Now I'm called aliquid-infigo. I'm a theme meant for hacking. Instead of turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there, this doofus is using me for his grotesque experiments by butchering my code.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
